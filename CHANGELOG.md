and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.8] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- **‚öôÔ∏è Default exposure_adjust changed to 0.0** - No additional exposure adjustment by default
  - Previous default: 1.0 (+1 stop brighter)
  - New default: 0.0 (use automatic brightness compensation only)
  - Applies to both 3-stop and 5-stop processors
  - Users can still adjust manually if needed (+/- 5 stops range)

## [1.1.7] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- **üé® Improved highlight/shadow mask generation** - Smoother, more gradual transitions
  - **Wider threshold ranges**: Highlight masks start earlier (0.6 vs 0.7), cover more area
  - **21√ó21 Gaussian smoothing**: Applied to all masks with sigma=7.0 for very gradual feathering
  - **No image blurring**: Smooths the blending masks, not the image itself
  - **Eliminates sharp cutoffs**: Gradual transitions prevent visible blend boundaries
  - **Consistent across highlights and shadows**: Both use improved mask generation

### Removed
- **Removed HDR region post-processing blur** - Caused unwanted image blurring

### Technical Details
- Masks now use both wider Hermite interpolation ranges AND Gaussian smoothing
- 21√ó21 kernel with sigma=7.0 creates very soft feathering (14 pixel transition zone)
- Affects blending behavior, not final image sharpness

## [1.1.6] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- **üé® HDR highlight post-processing** - Direct smoothing of HDR regions for grain reduction
  - **Selective Gaussian blur**: Only affects pixels with values > 1.0 (HDR highlights)
  - **9√ó9 kernel with sigma=2.0**: Effective grain reduction without over-blurring
  - **Smooth transition mask**: 15√ó15 Gaussian feathering prevents hard edges between smoothed/unsmoothed regions
  - **Preserves displayable range**: 0-1 values remain untouched (sharp EV0 base preserved)
  - **Fixes**: Directly smooths the final HDR values that appear grainy when exposed down in Nuke

### Technical Details
- Post-processing applied after detail injection (more effective than pre-filtering sources)
- Mask-based selective blending prevents affecting non-HDR regions
- Addresses grain created during injection process, not just source noise

## [1.1.5] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- **üé® Bilateral filtering for grain reduction** - Smoother highlight details in Nuke/Resolve
  - **Highlights (EV-2)**: 5x5 bilateral filter (sigmaColor=0.1, sigmaSpace=5)
  - **Extreme highlights (EV-4)**: 7x7 bilateral filter (sigmaColor=0.15, sigmaSpace=7) - stronger smoothing
  - **Shadows (EV+2/EV+4)**: 3x3 bilateral filter (sigmaColor=0.05, sigmaSpace=3) - light smoothing
  - **Edge-preserving smoothing**: Reduces AI-generated grain without losing important detail
  - **Fixes**: Highlights no longer appear grainy/sharp when exposed down in Nuke

### Technical Details
- Bilateral filtering applied to detail sources before injection
- Preserves edges and important detail while removing noise
- Stronger filtering for more underexposed images (more grain)
- Maintains HDR range and color accuracy

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **üîÜ Improved brightness compensation algorithm** - Better histogram distribution
  - **Now uses median-based scaling** for very dark images (median < 0.05)
  - **Uses mean-based scaling** for normal brightness images
  - **More permissive adjustment range**: 0.3x to 8.0x (was 0.5x to 4.0x)
  - **Better handling of shadow-heavy images** - prevents histogram crush to left
  - **Fixes**: Histogram no longer compressed to shadows, better tonal distribution

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- **üé® Detail Injection is now the DEFAULT algorithm** - Best results for AI-generated images
- **Simplified output: Linear HDR only** - Removed sRGB display option
  - Always outputs true linear HDR (perfect for EXR export)
  - Linear data is correct format for professional color grading
  - Preview may look contrasty in ComfyUI (this is expected and correct)
- **Algorithm order updated**: detail_injection listed first in dropdown menu

### Removed
- **Removed `output_colorspace` parameter** - Streamlined interface, always linear HDR output

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- **üé® Output Colorspace Selection** - New parameter for all HDR processors
  - **`srgb_display` (NEW DEFAULT)**: Tone-mapped output with Reinhard operator for natural preview in ComfyUI
  - **`linear_hdr`**: True linear HDR output for EXR export (may look contrasty in preview)
  - **Applies to all algorithms** - Consistent colorspace handling across radiance_fusion, detail_injection, etc.
  - **Smart tone mapping**: Reinhard operator compresses HDR values >1.0 into displayable range
  - **Preserves workflow flexibility**: Use sRGB for preview, linear for final EXR export

### Changed
- **Default output is now `srgb_display`** - Better out-of-box experience for ComfyUI users
- **Linear output properly documented** - Clear warnings that linear HDR looks contrasty in preview

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **üö® CRITICAL: Fixed inverted exposure adjustment formula** - Exposure adjustment was backwards!
  - **Bug**: `+1.0` stop was darkening (0.5x) instead of brightening (2.0x)
  - **Fix**: Removed negative sign from formula: `2^exposure_adjust` (was `2^(-exposure_adjust)`)
  - **Impact**: All exposure adjustments now work correctly (positive = brighter, negative = darker)
- **üîÜ Fixed Detail Injection producing dark images** - Added automatic brightness compensation
  - **Issue**: Output had mean 0.13 instead of target 0.18 (18% middle gray standard)
  - **Solution**: Automatic brightness scaling targets 0.18 mean for proper exposure
  - **Uses percentile-based mean** (middle 80%) for robustness against outliers
  - **Clamped to 0.5x-4.0x range** to prevent over-correction
  - **Preserves HDR values proportionally** while normalizing overall brightness
